Hi! Welcome to ModsForGSR_Watchy. This repository is made to document my efforts to supplement [the excellent Watchy_GSR watchface developed by GuruSR]([url](https://github.com/GuruSR/Watchy_GSR)). I will add modded files to add/enhance features to this watchface. Please refer to the original repo for installation instructions. All modified files are available in /Modified files to be used in src/ and /src/1.4.7/filename.extnsn

* Added functionality to cycle through watchfaces from the homescreen (when menu is not selected). To use the file, rename this to "Watchy_GSR.cpp" and place it in the GSR folder replacing the original file before compiling. Built on version 1.4.7A of GSR_Watchy.
* Working on adding a second timezone to the 7Seg detailed display. Added modified WatchyClassicsAddOn file named as "Modded_WatchyClassicsAddOn.h" in aforementioned locations. NOT complete yet - wathface modification done, still figuring out adding a secondary clock.
